        Shaperglot is a library and a utility for testing a font's language support.
        You give it a font, and it tells you what languages are supported and to what
        degree.
        
        Most other libraries to check for language support (for example, Rosetta's
        wonderful [hyperglot](https://hyperglot.rosettatype.com) library) do this by
        looking at the Unicode codepoints that the font supports. Shaperglot takes
        a different approach.
        
        ## What's wrong with the Unicode codepoint coverage approach?
        
        For many common languages, it's possible to check that the language is
        supported just by looking at the Unicode coverage. For example, to support
        English, you need the 26 lowercase and uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet.
        
        However, for the majority of scripts around the world, covering the codepoints
        needed is not enough to say that a font really *supports* a particular language.
        For correct language support, the font must also *behave* in a particular way.
        
        Take the case of Arabic as an example. A font might contain glyphs which cover
        all the codepoints in the Arabic block (0x600-0x6FF). But the font only *supports*
        Arabic if it implements joining rules for the `init`, `medi` and `fina` features.
        To say that a font supports Devanagari, it needs to implement conjuncts (which
        set of conjuncts need to be included before we can say the font "supports"
        Devanagari is debated...) and half forms, as well as contain a `languagesystem`
        statement which triggers Indic reordering.
        
        Even within the Latin script, a font only supports a language such as Turkish
        if its casing behaving respects the dotless / dotted I distinction; a font
        only supports Navajo if its ogonek anchoring is different to the anchoring used in
        Polish; and so on.
        
        But there's a further problem with testing language support by codepoint coverage:
        it encourages designers to "fill in the blanks" to get to support, rather than
        necessarily engage with the textual requirements of particular languages.
        
        ## Testing for behaviour, not coverage
        
        Shaperglot therefore determines language support not just on codepoint coverage,
        but also by examining how the font behaves when confronted with certain character
        sequences.
        
        The trick is to do this in a way which is not prescriptive. We know that there
        are many different ways of implementing language support within a font, and that
        design and other considerations will factor into precisely how a font is
        constructed. Shaperglot presents the font with different strings, and makes sure
        that "something interesting happened" - without necessarily specifying what.
        
        In the case of Arabic, we need to know that the `init` feature is present, and that
        when we shape some Arabic glyphs, the output with `init` turned on is different
        to the output with `init` turned off. We don't care what's different; we only
        care that something has happened. *(Yes, this still makes it possible to trick shaperglot into reporting support for a language which is not correctly implemented, but at that point, it's probably less effort to actually implement it...)*
        
        Shaperglot includes (or will include) the following kinds of test:
        
        * Certain codepoints were mapped to base or mark glyphs.
        * A named feature was present.
        * A named feature changed the output glyphs.
        * A mark glyph was attached to a base glyph or composed into a precomposed glyph (but not left unattached).
        * Certain glyphs in the output were different to one another.
        * Languagesystems were defined in the font.
        * ...
        
        Using this library of tests, we then create language support definitions which
        exercise the font's capabilities to obtain a fuller picture of its support for
        a particular language. These language support definitions, expressed as YAML
        files, are the core of Shaperglot; to extend and improve Shaperglot, we need as
        many language support definition files as possible - so if you know a language
        well and can express what it means to "support" that language properly, please
        contribute a definition!
        
        ## Using Shaperglot
        
        To report whether or not a given language is supported, pass a font and one or
        more ISO639-3 language codes. 
        
        ```
        $ shaperglot -v -v MyFont.ttf urd
        Font does not fully support language 'urd'
         * PASS: All base glyphs were present in the font
         * FAIL: Some mark glyphs were missing: ْ
         * PASS: Required feature 'mark' was present
         * PASS: Mark glyph ◌َ  (FATHA) took part in a mark positioning rule
         * PASS: Mark glyph ◌ُ  (DAMMA) took part in a mark positioning rule
         * PASS: Mark glyph ◌ِ  (KASRA) took part in a mark positioning rule
         * PASS: Mark glyph ◌ٰ  (LONG_A) took part in a mark positioning rule
         * PASS: Required feature 'init' was present
         * PASS: Glyph ع (AINu1) took part in a init rule
         * PASS: Required feature 'medi' was present
         * PASS: Glyph ع (AINu1) took part in a medi rule
         * PASS: Required feature 'fina' was present
         * PASS: Glyph ع (AINu1) took part in a fina rule
         * PASS: Repeated beh forms should produce different shapes
         * PASS: Initial and final forms should differ
        ```
        
        Shaperglot can also be run in bulk mode to check language support of entire font libraries. This is done by running `bulk-run-sg-.py` located in the scripts folder.
        
        ```
        $ python bulk-run-sg.py ./<path-to-font-library>
        ```
        
        This script will automatically drill down the direcory tree and identify all .ttf font files and check them against a subset of language tags. At this time `bulk-run-sg.py` only checks fonts for Pan-African language support. The list of relevant language tags are defined in `data/iso639-3-afr-all.txt`. Shaperglot results procesed in bulk can be quite large and may require additional tools to analyze. See [font-lang-support-afr](https://github.com/JamraPatel/font-lang-support-afr) for an example of how bulk results can be reported. Results are saved into two `.json` files.
        
        ```
        results.json
        afr_tag_overview.json
        ```
        
        `results.json` contains the checker results (`<failure type>: <failure details>`) for each language tag, broken down by font.
        `afr_tag_overview.json` is a summary of which fonts in the library pass and fail for each language tag that was checked.

To report whether or not a given language is supported, pass a font and one or

```
$ shaperglot -v -v MyFont.ttf urd
Font does not fully support language 'urd'
 * PASS: All base glyphs were present in the font
 * FAIL: Some mark glyphs were missing: ْ
 * PASS: Required feature 'mark' was present
 * PASS: Mark glyph ◌َ  (FATHA) took part in a mark positioning rule
 * PASS: Mark glyph ◌ُ  (DAMMA) took part in a mark positioning rule

 * PASS: Mark glyph ◌ٰ  (LONG_A) took part in a mark positioning rule
 * PASS: Required feature 'init' was present
 * PASS: Glyph ع (AINu1) took part in a init rule
 * PASS: Required feature 'medi' was present
 * PASS: Glyph ع (AINu1) took part in a medi rule
 * PASS: Required feature 'fina' was present
 * PASS: Glyph ع (AINu1) took part in a fina rule
 * PASS: Repeated beh forms should produce different shapes
 * PASS: Initial and final forms should differ
```

Shaperglot can also be run in bulk mode to check language support of entire font libraries. This is done by running `bulk-run-sg-.py` located in the scripts folder.

```
$ python bulk-run-sg.py ./<path-to-font-library>
```

This script will automatically drill down the direcory tree and identify all .ttf font files and check them against a subset of language tags. At this time `bulk-run-sg.py` only checks fonts for Pan-African language support. The list of relevant language tags are defined in `data/iso639-3-afr-all.txt`. Shaperglot results procesed in bulk can be quite large and may require additional tools to analyze. See [font-lang-support-afr](https://github.com/JamraPatel/font-lang-support-afr) for an example of how bulk results can be reported. Results are saved into two `.json` files.

```
results.json
afr_tag_overview.json
```

`results.json` contains the checker results (`<failure type>: <failure details>`) for each language tag, broken down by font.
`afr_tag_overview.json` is a summary of which fonts in the library pass and fail for each language tag that was checked.
